## Overview

## üåé A Sharkish microblogging platform ü¶àüöÄ 

_Sharkey_ is an Misskey fork following upstream changes when possible, with added features!

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PLEASE READ CAREFULLY ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Sharkey** requires **redis** version **7**, but YunoHost does not currently support this version.
Some functions will not be available if you install this package.

I advise you to wait for the release of _Bookworm_ Debian 12.


**Shipped version:** 2024.5.1~ynh1
